## Features
* Flourish Studio animated bar chart race generator.

## Usage (tutorial)
### Installation
Make sure you have .NET Core 5.0 installed (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0). Download the latest release from [Releases tab](https://github.com/kolya5544/NSCharts/releases) and execute NSCharts.exe file.
### Configuration
Once you execute the application, you'll see a Windows application GUI. Use properties dropbox to choose the property (census) that will be used to build the chart on. If you want to specify a custom date range, check the "Custom datetime" checkbox and choose your range. Otherwise, the program will use all available records of a nation. Press "Confirm". Now, add nations using "Country to add" textbox, one by one. If you've added a wrong country, doubleclick on its name in the listbox to remove it. Once you are done, press "Export" and save the file somewhere.
### Creating a chart race
We are using Flourish Studio for a neat visualisation. Create an account and press "Create visualization" [here](https://app.flourish.studio/@flourish/bar-chart-race). Once you are done, go to "Data" tab and press "Upload data". Use the file you've exported. Press "Import publicly". On the right, remove any values from "Categories" or "Images", set "Values" to "B-ZZ" and "Label" to "A". You can edit country names under "Country name" as well. Now, go to "Preview" and you will see your animated chart race. Use settings on the right to configure the animation.
### Exporting a race animation
I don't think there is a way. I use recording software to record a fragment of my screen.

Have fun!
